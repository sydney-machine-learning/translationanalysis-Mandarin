"After Ah Q had kowtowed and complied with the Chao family's terms, he went 
back as usual to the Tutelary God's Temple. The sun had gone down, and he began 
to feel that something was wrong. Careful thought led him to the conclusion that 
this was probably because his back was bare. Remembering that he still had a 
ragged lined jacket, he put it on and lay down, and when he opened his eyes 
again the sun was already shining on the top of the west wall. He sat up, 
saying, ""Curse it. . . ."""
"After getting up he loafed about the streets as usual, until he began to feel 
that something else was wrong, though this was not to be compared to the 
physical discomfort of a bare back. Apparently, from that day onwards all the 
women in Weichuang became shy of Ah Q: whenever they saw him coming they took 
refuge indoors. In fact, even Mrs. Tsou who was nearly fifty years old retreated 
in confusion with the rest, calling her eleven-year-old daughter to go inside. 
This struck Ah Q as very strange. ""The bitches!"" he thought. ""They have suddenly 
become as coy as young ladies. . . ."""
"A good many days later, however, he felt even more strongly that something 
was wrong. First, the wine shop refused him credit; secondly, the old man in 
charge of the Tutelary God's Temple made some uncalled-for remarks, as if he 
wanted Ah Q to leave; and thirdly, for many days—how many exactly he could not 
remember—not a soul had come to hire him. To be refused credit in the wine shop 
he could put up with; if the old man kept urging him to leave, Ah Q could just 
ignore his complaints; but when no one came to hire him he had to go hungry; and 
this was really a ""cursed"" state to be in."
"When Ah Q could stand it no longer he went to his regular employers' houses 
to find out what was the matter—it was only Mr. Chao's threshold that he was 
not allowed to cross. But he met with a very strange reception. The one to 
appear was always a man, who looked thoroughly annoyed and waved Ah Q away as if 
he were a beggar, saying: ""There is nothing, nothing at all! Go away!"""
"Ah Q found it more and more extraordinary. ""These people always needed help 
in the past,"" he thought. ""They can't suddenly have nothing to be done. This 
looks fishy."" After making careful enquiries he found out that when they had any 
odd jobs they all called in Young D. Now this Young D was a lean and weakly 
pauper, even lower in Ah Q's eyes than Whiskers Wang. Who could have thought 
that this low fellow would steal his living from him? So this time Ah Q's 
indignation was greater than usual, and going on his way, fuming, he suddenly 
raised his arm and sang: 
""
I'll thrash you with 
a steel mace
. . . . """
"A few days later he did indeed meet Young D in front of Mr. Chien's house. 
""When two foes meet, their eyes flash fire."" As Ah Q went up to him, Young D 
stood still."
"""Stupid ass!"" hissed Ah Q, glaring furiously and foaming at the mouth."
"""I'm an insect—will that do? "" asked Young D."
"Such modesty only made Ah Q angrier than ever, but since he had no steel mace 
in his hand all he could do was to rush forward with outstretched hand to seize 
Young D's pigtail. Young D, while protecting his pigtail with one hand, tried to 
seize Ah Q's with the other, whereupon Ah Q also used one free hand to protect 
his own pigtail. In the past Ah Q had never considered Young D worth taking 
seriously, but since he had recently suffered from hunger himself he was now as 
thin and weak as his opponent, so that they presented a spectacle of evenly 
matched antagonists. Four hands clutched at two heads, both men bending at the 
waist, cast a blue, rainbow-shaped shadow on the Chien family's white wall for 
over half an hour."
"""All right! All right!"" exclaimed some of the onlookers, probably trying to 
make peace."
"""Good, good!"" exclaimed others, but whether to make peace, applaud the 
fighters or incite them on to further efforts, is not certain. The two combatants turned deaf ears to them all, however. If Ah Q advanced 
three paces, Young D would recoil three paces, and so they would stand. If Young 
D advanced three paces, Ah Q would recoil three paces, and so they would stand 
again. After about half an hour—Weichuang had few striking clocks, so it is 
difficult to tell the time; it may have been twenty minutes—when steam was 
rising from their heads and sweat pouring down their cheeks, Ah Q let fall his 
hands, and in the same second Young D's hands fell too. They straightened up 
simultaneously and stepped back simultaneously, pushing their way out through 
the crowd."
"""You'll be hearing from me again, curse you! . . ."" said Ah Q over his 
shoulder."
"""Curse you! You'll be hearing from me again . . ."" echoed Young D, also over 
his shoulder."
"This epic struggle had apparently ended neither in victory nor defeat, and it 
is not known whether the spectators were satisfied or not, for none of them 
expressed any opinion. But still not a soul came to hire Ah Q."
"One warm day, when a balmy breeze seemed to give some foretaste of summer, Ah 
Q actually felt cold; but he could put up with this—his greatest worry was an 
empty stomach. His cotton quilt, felt bar and shirt had long since disappeared, 
and after that he had sold his padded jacket. Now nothing was left but his 
trousers, and these of course he could not take off. He had a ragged lined 
jacket, it is true; but this was certainly worthless, unless he gave it away to 
be made into shoe soles. He had long hoped to pick up a sum of money on the 
road, but hitherto he had not been successful; he had also hoped he might 
suddenly discover a sum of money in his tumbledown room, and had looked wildly 
all through it, but the room was quite, quite empty. Thereupon he made up his 
mind to go out in search of food."
"As he walked along the road ""in search of food"" he saw the familiar wine shop 
and the familiar steamed bread, but he passed them by without pausing for a 
second, without even hankering after them. It was not these he was looking for, 
although what exactly he was looking for he did nor know himself."
"Since Weichuang was not a big place, he soon left it behind. Most of the 
country outside the village consisted of paddy fields, green as far as the eye 
could see with the tender shoots of young rice, dotted here and there with 
round, black, moving objects, which were peasants cultivating the fields. But 
blind to the delights of country life, Ah Q simply went on his way, for he knew 
instinctively that this was far removed from his ""search for food."" Finally, 
however, he came to the walls of the Convent of Quiet Self-improvement."
"The convent too was surrounded by paddy fields, its white walls standing out 
sharply in the fresh green, and inside the low earthen wall at the back was a 
vegetable garden. Ah Q hesitated for a time, looking around him. Since there was 
no one in sight he scrambled on to the low wall, holding on to some milkwort. 
The mud wall started crumbling, and Ah Q shook with fear; however, by clutching 
at the branch of a mulberry tree he managed to jump over it. Within was a wild 
profusion of vegetation, but no sign of yellow wine, steamed bread, or anything 
edible. A clump of bamboos, with many young shoots, grew by the west wall but 
unfortunately these shoots were not cooked. There was also rape which had long 
since gone to seed; the mustard was already about to flower, and the small 
cabbages looked very tough."
"Ah Q felt as resentful as a scholar who has failed in the examinations. As he 
walked slowly towards the gate of the garden he gave a start of joy, for there 
before him what did he see but a patch of turnips! He knelt down and began 
pulling, when suddenly a round head appeared from behind the gate, only to be 
withdrawn again at once. This was no other than the little nun. Now though Ah Q 
had always had the greatest contempt for such people as little nuns, there are 
times when ""Discretion is the better part of valour."" He hastily pulled up four 
turnips, tore off the leaves and folded them in his jacket. By this time an old 
nun had already come out."
"""May Buddha preserve us, Ah Q! What made you climb into our garden to steal 
turnips! . . . Oh dear, what a wicked thing to do! Oh dear, Buddha preserve us! 
. . ."""
"""When did I ever climb into your garden and steal turnips?"" retorted Ah Q, as 
he started off, still looking at her."
"""Now—aren't you?"" said the old nun, pointing at the folds of his jacket."
"""Are these yours? Can you make them answer you? You. . . . ."""
"Leaving his sentence unfinished, Ah Q took to his heels as fast as he could, 
followed by an enormously fat, black dog. Originally this dog had been at the 
front gate, and how it reached the back garden was a mystery. With a snarl the 
black dog gave chase and was just about to bite Ah Q's leg when most opportunely 
a turnip fell from his jacket, and the dog, taken by surprise, stopped for a 
second. During this time Ah Q scrambled up the mulberry tree, scaled the mud 
wall and fell, turnips and all, outside the convent. He left the black dog still 
barking by the mulberry tree, and the old nun saying her prayers."
"Fearing that the nun would let the black dog our again, Ah Q gathered 
together his turnips and ran, picking up a few small stones as he went. But the 
black dog did not reappear. Ah Q threw away the stones and walked on, eating as 
he went, thinking to himself: ""There is nothing to be had here; I had better go 
to town. . . ."""
"By the time he had finished the third turnip, he had made up his mind to go 
to town."
