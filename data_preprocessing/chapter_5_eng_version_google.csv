"After Ayei, he still returned to Tugu Temple. The sun went down, and gradually felt a little weird in the world.He thought about it, and finally realized that the reason was covered in his own shirtlessness.He remembered that the broken clip was still there, he put it on his body, lay down, and opened his eyes. It turned out that the sun was already on the west wall again.He sat up and said, ""Mom's ..."""
"After he got up, he still strolled on the street. Although it was no more painful than the pain of shirtlessness, he gradually felt a bit strange in the world.As if from this day, the women of Wei Zhuang suddenly were afraid of shame. When I saw that Aqi came, they hid in the door.Even Zou Qiyi, nearly fifty -year -old, also followed others, and called the eleven daughters in.Aqi thought he was surprising, and thought: ""Suddenly these things have learned to look like a lady. This daughter -in -law ..."""
"But he felt a little weird in the world, but it was a lot of days.First, the hotel was unwilling to owe it; second, the old man in Guan Tugu Temple said something nonsense, and seemed to call him away. Third, although he couldn't remember for many days, there were many days.Short worker.The hotel is not stunned, and it is boiled; the old man urges him to leave, and even Su Yitong is even if no one comes to call him a short worker, but he is hungry: This is really a non -common ""mother"" thing."
"Aq couldn't bear it anymore, he had to go to the house of the Pianchi to ask -but he was not allowed to step into the threshold of Zhao's house -but the situation was also different: he must go out of a man, and now he is very annoying.Like a response to a beggar, he shakes his hand: ""No! You go out!"""
"The more Aq feels strange.He thought that these people have always been indispensable to help, so that there is no such thing now, it should always be a little strange.He kept inquiring and knew that they had to call Xiao Don㈣ when they had something to do.This little D is a poor boy, thin and lacking. In Aqi's eyes, the location was under Wang Hu. Who would expect this kid to seek his rice bowl.Therefore, Aq's anger is even more different from usual. When he walks angrily, he suddenly raised his hand and sang: ""I hold you with a steel whip!"
"A few days later, he met Xiao D in front of Qianfu's picture wall.""The enemies met with each other"", and Aqi greeted him, and Xiao D stood up."
"""Beast!"" Ah said angrily, spitting from the corner of his mouth."
"""I'm a worm, okay? ..."" Xiao D said."
"This humility made Ah even more angry, but he had no steel whip in his hand, so he had to rush up and reached out to pull the small D's braids.Little D protects his braid roots with one hand, and he also comes to pull Ah's braids in one hand. Ah also protects his braid roots with empty hands.From the previous perspective of Aqi, Little D was originally insufficient, but he was hungry recently, thin and lack of small D, so it became a common phenomenon.They all bent, and a blue rainbow shape was released on the Qianjia Pink Wall, as for a long time."
"""Okay, okay!"" The people who watched said, it was about persuasion."
"""Okay, okay!"" The people said, I don't know if it is persuasion, praise, or incite. But they don't listen.Aqi entered three steps, and the little D took three steps and stood all; three steps, Aye took three steps and stood again.About a little bit, ——Wezhuang has few self -self -clocks, so it is difficult to say, or twenty points -their hair is smoking, and the forehead sweats. Aya’s hand was loosened. At the same time,Little D's hand was also relaxing, at the same time straight, retreating at the same time, all crowded out."
"""Remember, my mother ..."" Ai said back."
"""Mom, remember ..."" Xiao D also turned back."
"This ""Dragon Tiger Fighting"" does not seem to be victorious, nor does it know that people who watch can be satisfied, and there is no discussion, but no one still calls him to be a short worker."
"One day was very gentle, and the breeze was a little bit summer, but Aqi felt cold, but this was still responsible. The first was hungry.Cotton, felt hat, cloth shirt, no longer, and then sold cotton jackets; now there are pants, but they are inevitable; there are broken clips, and in addition to sending people as the soles, they decided not to sell.He wanted to pick up a money on the road, but he has not seen it yet; he wants to suddenly find a money in his broken house, panic, but the house is empty and clear.So he decided to go out for food."
"He walked on the road to ""ask for food"", saw the familiar hotel, and saw the familiar buns, but he had gone through. Not only did he not be suspended, but he didn't want it.What he asked for wasn't such a thing; what he asked for, he didn't know."
"Weizhuang was not in Daicun Town, and after a long time, it went through.Most of the villages are paddy fields, the eyes are full of tender green, and the black spots of several round activities are sandwiched.Aqi did not appreciate this Tianjiale, but just left, because he intuitively knew that the way of ""eating"" with him was very long.But he finally walked outside the wall of Jing Xiuyu."
"There is also a paddy field around the ，, and the pink wall protrudes in the new green, and the low earth wall behind is a vegetable garden.Aq hesitated for a while, looked around, and no one.He climbed up the low wall and pulled Ho Shouwu vine, but the soil was still fell off, and Aqi's feet shook; finally climbed mulberry branches and jumped into it.It is really lush inside, but it does not seem to have rice wine buns, as well as other foods.The west wall is a bamboo bush, and many bamboo shoots below are unfortunately not cooked. There are also early tunnels of rapeseed. Mustard has blossomed and cabbage is very old."
"Aq feels very wronged as if Wen Tongshi. He slowly approached the garden door, and he was very surprised. This was clearly an old radish.He squatted down and pulled it down, and suddenly a very round head was out of the door, and he retracted back. This was clearly a little nun.The flow of the little nun was that Aye had regarded as a mustard, but the world had to ""take a step back"", so he quickly pulled up four radishes, twisted the green leaves, and pocked in the big placket.But the old nun has come out."
"""Amitabha, Aq, how do you jump into the garden to steal radish! ... Ah, sin, A Mi, Amitabha! ..."""
"""When will I jump into your garden to steal radish?"" Aya said and walked away."
"""Now ... isn't this?"" Lao Ni pointed at his pocket."
"""Is this yours? Can you call him promise you? You ..."""
"Aqi didn't finish talking, and ran away; he chased a very fat black dog.This was originally in the front door, but somehow came to the back garden.The black dog hummed and chased, and she was already biting Aqi's legs. Fortunately, a radish was fell from the pocket. The dog was scared and stopped slightly.Get out of the wall.Only the black dog was still facing the mulberry cricket, and the old nun was thinking about the Buddha."
"Ah was afraid that Nuni would release the black dog again, picked up the radish and walked away. He picked up a few small stones along the road, but the black dog did not reproduce.Aqi threw the stone and walked while eating, and thought that there was nothing to find here. It might as well go to the city ..."
"When the three radish finished eating, he had made up the idea of ​​entering the city."
