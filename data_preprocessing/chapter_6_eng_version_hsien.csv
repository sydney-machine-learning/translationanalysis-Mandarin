"Weichuang did not see Ah Q again till just after the Moon Festival that year. 
Everybody was surprised to hear of his return, and this made them think back and 
wonder where he had been all that time. The few previous occasions on which Ah Q 
had been to town, he had usually informed people in advance with great gusto; 
but since he had not done so this time, no one had noticed his going. He might 
have told the old man in charge of the Tutelary God's Temple, but according to 
the custom of Weichuang it was only when Mr. Chao, Mr. Chien, or the successful 
county candidate went to town that it was considered important. Even the 
Imitation Foreign Devil's going was not talked about, much less Ah Q's. This 
would explain why the old man had not spread the news for him, with the result 
that the villagers had had no means of knowing."
"Ah Q's return this time was very different from before, and in fact quite 
enough to occasion astonishment. The day was growing dark when he appeared 
blinking sleepily before the door of the wine shop, walked up to the counter, 
pulled a handful of silver and coppers from his belt and tossed them on the 
counter. ""Cash!"" he said. ""Bring the wine!"" He was wearing a new, lined jacket, 
and at his waist evidently hung a large purse, the great weight of which caused 
his belt to sag in a sharp curve. It was the custom in Weichuang that when there 
seemed to be something unusual about anyone, he should be treated with respect 
rather than insolence, and now, although they knew quite well that this was Ah 
Q, still he was very different from the Ah Q of the ragged coat. The ancients 
say, ""A scholar who has been away three days must be looked at with new eyes."" 
So the waiter, innkeeper, customers and passers-by, all quite naturally 
expressed a kind of suspicion mingled with respect. The innkeeper started by 
nodding, then said:"
"""Hullo, Ah Q, so you're back!"""
"""Yes, I'm back."""
"""You've made money . . . er . . . where. . .?"""
"""I went to town."""
"By the next day this piece of news had spread through Weichuang. And since 
everybody wanted to hear the success story of this Ah Q of the ready money and 
the new lined jacket, in the wine shop, tea-house, and under the temple eaves, 
the villagers gradually ferreted out the news. The result was that they began to 
treat Ah Q with a new deference."
"According to Ah Q, he had been a servant in the house of a successful 
provincial candidate. This part of the story filled all who heard it with awe. 
This successful provincial candidate was named Pai, but because he was the only 
successful provincial candidate in the whole town there was no need to use his 
surname: whenever anyone spoke of the successful provincial candidate, it meant 
him. And this was so not only in Weichuang but everywhere within a radius of 
thirty miles, as if everybody imagined his name to be Mr. Successful Provincial 
Candidate. To have worked in the household of such a man naturally called for 
respect; but according to Ah Q's further statements, he was unwilling to go on 
working there because this successful candidate was really too much of a 
""turtle's egg."" This part of the story made all who heard it sigh, but with a 
sense of pleasure, because it showed that Ah Q was actually not fit to work in 
such a man's household, yet not to work was a pity."
"According to Ah Q, his return was also due to the fact that he was not 
satisfied with the townspeople because they called a long bench a straight 
bench, used shredded shallots to fry fish, and—a defect he had recently 
discovered—the women did not sway in a very satisfactory manner as they walked. 
However, the town had its good points too; for instance, in Weichuang everyone 
played with thirty-two bamboo counters, and only the Imitation Foreign Devil 
could play mah-jong, but in town even the street urchins excelled at mah-jong. 
You had only to place the Imitation Foreign Devil in the hands of these young 
rascals in their teens, for him straightway to become like ""a small devil before 
the King of Hell."" This part of the story made all who heard it blush."
"""Have you seen an execution?"" asked Ah Q. ""Ah, that's a fine sight. . . . 
When they execute the revolutionaries. . . . Ah, that's a fine sight, a fine 
sight. . . . ."" "" As he shook his head, his spittle flew on to the face of Chao 
Szu-chen who stood directly opposite. This part of the story made all who heard 
it tremble. Then with a glance around, he suddenly raised his right hand and 
dropped it on the neck of Whiskers Wang, who, his head thrust forward, was 
listening with rapt attention."
"""Kill!"" shouted Ah Q."
"Whiskers Wang gave a start, and drew in his head as fast as lightning or a 
spark struck from a flint, while the bystanders shivered with pleasurable 
apprehension. After this, Whiskers Wang went about in a daze for many days, and 
dared not go near Ah Q, nor did the others."
"Although we cannot say that in the eyes of the inhabitants of Weichuang Ah 
Q's status at this time was superior to that of Mr. Chao, we can at least affirm 
without any danger of inaccuracy that it was about the same."
"Not long after, Ah Q's fame suddenly spread into the women's apartments of 
Weichuang too. Although the only two families of any pretensions in Weichuang 
were those of Chien and Chao, and nine-tenths of the rest were poor, still 
women's apartments are women's apartments, and the way Ah Q's fame spread into 
them was something of a miracle. When the womenfolk met they would say to each 
other, ""Mrs. Tsou bought a blue silk skirt from Ah Q. Although it was old, it 
only cost ninety cents. And Chao Pai-yen's mother (this has yet to be verified, 
because some say it was Chao Szu-chen's mother) bought a child's costume of 
crimson foreign calico, which was nearly new, for only three hundred cash, less 
eight per cent discount."" Then those who had no silk skirt or needed foreign calico were most anxious 
to see Ah Q in order to buy from him. Far from avoiding him now, they sometimes 
followed him when he passed, calling to him to stop."
"""Ah Q, have you any more silk skirts?"" they would ask. ""No? We want foreign 
calico too. Do you have any?"""
"This news later spread from the poor households to the rich ones, because 
Mrs. Tsou was so pleased with her silk skirt that she took it to Mrs. Chao for 
her approval, and Mrs. Chao told Mr. Chao, speaking very highly of it. Mr. Chao discussed the matter that evening at dinner with his son, the 
successful county candidate, suggesting that there must be something queer about 
Ah Q, and that they should be more careful about their doors and windows. They 
did not know, though, whether Ah Q had any things left or not, and thought he 
might still have something good. Since Mrs. Chao happened to want a good, cheap, 
fur jacket, after a family council it was decided to ask Mrs. Tsou to find Ah Q 
for them at once. For this a third exception was made to the rule, special 
permission being given that evening for a lamp to be lit."
"A considerable amount of oil had been burned, but still there was no sign of 
Ah Q. The whole Chao household was yawning with impatience, some of them 
resented Ah Q's undisciplined ways, others angrily blamed Mrs. Tsou for not 
trying harder to get him there. Mrs. Chao was afraid that Ah Q dared not come 
because of the terms agreed upon that spring, but Mr. Chao did nor think this 
anything to worry about, because, as he said, ""This time I sent for him."" Sure 
enough, Mr. Chao proved himself a man of insight, for Ah Q finally arrived with 
Mrs. Tsou."
"""He keeps saying he has nothing left,"" panted Mrs. Tsou as she came in. ""When 
I told him to come and tell you so himself he went on talking. I told him. . . 
."""
"""Sir!"" said Ah Q with an attempt at a smile, coming to a halt under the 
eaves."
"""I hear you got rich out there, Ah Q,"" said Mr. Chao, going up to him and 
looking him over carefully. ""Very good. Now . . . they say you have some old 
things. . . . Bring them all here for us to look at. . . . This is simply 
because I happen to want. . . ."""
"""I told Mrs. Tsou—there is nothing left."""
"""Nothing left?"" Mr. Chao could not help sounding disappointed. ""How could 
they go so quickly?"""
"""They belonged to a friend, and there was not much to begin with. People 
bought some. . . . ."""
"""There must be something left."""
"""There is only a door curtain left."""
"""Then bring the door curtain for us to see,"" said Mrs. Chao hurriedly."
"""Well, it will be all right if you bring it tomorrow,"" said Mr. Chao without 
much enthusiasm. ""When you have anything in future, Ah Q, you must bring it to 
us first. . . . ."""
"""We certainly will not pay less than other people!"" said the successful 
county candidate. His wife shot a hasty glance at Ah Q to see his reaction."
"""I need a fur jacket,"" said Mrs. Chao."
"Although Ah Q agreed, he slouched out so carelessly that they did not know 
whether he had taken their instructions to heart or not. This made Mr. Chao so 
disappointed, annoyed and worried that he even stopped yawning. The successful 
candidate was also far from satisfied with Ah Q's attitude, and said, ""People 
should be on their guard against such a turtle's egg. It might be best to order 
the bailiff to forbid him to live in Weichuang."" Mr. Chao did not agree, saying that he might bear a grudge, and that in a 
business like this it was probably a case of ""the eagle does not prey on its own 
nest"": his own village need not worry, and they need only be a little more 
watchful at night. The successful candidate, much impressed by this parental 
instruction, immediately withdrew his proposal for driving Ah Q away, but 
cautioned Mrs. Tsou on no account to repeat what he had said."
"The next day, however, when Mrs. Tsou took her blue skirt to be dyed black 
she repeated these insinuations about Ah Q, although not actually mentioning 
what the successful candidate had said about driving him away. Even so, it was 
most damaging to Ah Q. In the first place, the bailiff appeared at his door and 
took away the door curtain. Although Ah Q protested that Mrs. Chao wanted to see 
it, the bailiff would not give it back, and even demanded a monthly payment of 
hush-money. In the second place, the villagers' respect for him suddenly 
changed. Although they still dared not take liberties, they avoided him as much 
as possible. While this differed from their previous fear of his ""Kill!"", it 
closely resembled the attitude of the ancients to spirits: they kept a 
respectful distance."
"Some idlers who wanted to get to the bottom of the business went to question 
Ah Q carefully. And with no attempt at concealment, Ah Q told them proudly of 
his experiences. They learned that he had merely been a petty thief, not only 
unable to climb walls, but even unable to go through openings: he simply stood 
outside an opening to receive the stolen goods. One night he had just received a package and his chief had gone in again, 
when he heard a great uproar inside, and took to his heels as fast as he could. 
He fled from the town that same night, back to Weichuang; and after this he 
dared not return to such a business. This story, however, was even more damaging 
to Ah Q, since the villagers had been keeping a respectful distance because they 
did not want to incur his enmity; for who could have guessed that he was only a 
thief who dared not steal again? Now they knew he was really too low to inspire 
fear."
