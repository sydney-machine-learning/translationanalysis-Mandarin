0,"After Ah Q Li Li, he still returned to Tugu Temple. The sun went down, and gradually felt that there were some ancient trails in the world.He thought carefully and finally realized: The reason was covered with shirtlessness.He remembered that the broken clip was still there, he put it on his body, lay down, and opened his eyes. It turned out that the sun was already on the west wall again.He sat up and said, ""Mom's ..."""
1,"After he got up, he still strolled on the street. Although he was no more painful than shirtless, he gradually felt that there were some ancient trails in the world.As if from this day, the women in Weizhuang suddenly were afraid of shame. When I saw that Ah Q came, they all hid in the door.Even Zou Qiyi, nearly fifty -year -old, also followed others, and called her 11 -year -old daughter in.Ah Q thought was surprising, and thought: ""Suddenly these things have learned the lady. This daughter -in -law ..."""
2,"But he felt a little weird in the world, and rules for many days.First, the hotel was unwilling to owe it; second, the old man of the Guan Shigu Temple said something nonsense and seemed to call him away. Third, although he couldn't remember for many days, there were many days. No one came to call him him.Be a short worker.The hotel is not stunned, and it is boiled; the old man urges him to leave, and even Su Yitong is just as good as it; but no one came to call him a short worker, but he was hungry by A Q: This is really a very ""mother"" thing."
3,"Ah Q couldn't bear it anymore, he had to go to the house of the Pianchi to inquire, -once he was not allowed to step into the threshold of Zhao's house, but the situation was also strange: he must go out of a man, and now he is very annoying.Beggar shakes hands:"
4,"""No! You go out!"""
5,"Ah Q feels more strange.He thought that these people have always been indispensable to help, so that there is no problem now, it should always be a little strange.He kept inquiring and knew that they had to call Xiao Don color when they had something.This little D is a poor boy, thin and lacking. In Ah Q's eyes, the position is under Wang Hu. Who would like to compete for his rice bowl.Therefore, Ah Q is even more different from usual. When walking angrily, he suddenly raised his hand and sang:"
6,"""I hold you with a steel whip! ..."""
7,"A few days later, he met Xiao D in front of Qianfu's picture wall.""The enemies met with each other."" Ah Q welcomed, and Xiao D stood up."
8,"""Beast!"" Ah Q said angrily, and his mouth was spitting out of his mouth."
9,"""I'm a worm, okay? ..."" Xiao D said."
10,"This humility made Ah Q more angry, but he had no steel whip in his hand, so he had to rush up and reached out to pull the braid of Xiao D.Xiao D protects his braid roots with one hand, and he also comes to pull Ah Q's braids in one hand. A Q also protects his braid roots in his empty hand.From the previous perspective of Ah Q, Xiao D was originally insufficient, but he was hungry recently, thin and lack of Little D, so it became a phenomenon of being evenly matched.They all bent, and a blue rainbow shape was released on the Qianjia Pink Wall, as for a long time."
11,"""Okay, okay!"" The people who watched said, it was about persuasion."
12,"""Okay, okay!"" The people said, I don't know if it is persuasion, praise, or stir."
13,"But they don't listen.Three steps in A Q, Xiao D took three steps and stood all; Xiao D took three steps, Ah Q took three steps and stood again.At about a little, there are few self -clocks in Weizhuang, so it is difficult to say, or twenty points. As soon as their hair is smoking, they sweat on their foreheads. Ah Q's hand was loosened. At the same time, small D’sThe hands were also relaxed, at the same time, straight, retreating at the same time, all of them squeezed out of the crowd."
14,"""Remember, mother's ..."" Ah Q turned back."
15,"""Mom, remember"" Xiao D also turned back."
16,"This ""Dragon Tiger Fighting"" does not seem to be victorious, and people who do not know that they can be satisfied. None of the discussion is issued, and no one still calls him to be a short worker."
17,"One day was very gentle, and the breeze was a little bit summer, but A Q felt cold, but this was still responsible. The first was hungry.Cotton, felt hats, cloth shirts, have long been gone, followed by cotton jackets: now there are pants, calamity is inevitable; there is a broken clip jacket, and except for sending people to make a sole, it is decided not to sell money.He wanted to pick up a money on the road, but so far he has not seen it: he wants to suddenly find a money in his broken house. He panicked, but the room was empty and clear.So he decided to go out for food."
18,"He walked on the road to ""ask for food"", saw the familiar hotel, and saw the familiar buns, but he had gone through. Not only did he not be suspended, but he didn't want it.What he asked for wasn't such a thing; what he asked for, he didn't know."
19,"Weizhuang was not in Daicun Town, and after a long time, it went through.Most of the villages are paddy fields, the eyes are full of tender green, and the black spots of several round activities are sandwiched.A Q didn't appreciate this Tianjiale, but he just left, because he intuitively knew that the way of ""eating"" with him was very long.But he finally walked outside the wall of Jing Xiuyu."
20,"There is also a paddy field around the ，, and the pink wall protrudes in the new green, and the low earth wall behind is a vegetable garden.Ah Q hesitated for a while, looked at each other on all sides, and no one.He climbed into this low wall and pulled Ho Shouwu vine, but the soil was still losingly, and A Q's feet shook; finally climbed mulberry branches and jumped into it.It is really lush inside, but it does not seem to have rice wine buns, as well as other foods.The west wall is a bamboo bush, and many bamboo shoots below are unfortunately cooked in the end. There are also early tunnels of rapeseed. Mustard has blossomed and cabbage is very old."
21,"Ah Q felt uncomfortable as if Wen Tongshi was in the middle of the garden, and he was very surprised. This was clearly an old radish.He squatted down and pulled it down, and suddenly a very round head was out of the door, and he shrank back. This was clearly a little nun.The flow of the aunt of the little nun was that Ah Q had originally regarded the grass and mustard, but the world had to ""retreat"", so he quickly pulled up four radishes, twisted the green leaves, and pocked in the big placket.But the old nun has come out."
22,"""Amitabha, Ah Q, how do you jump into the garden to steal radish! Ah, sin, Ah, Amitabha! ..."""
23,"""When will I jump into your garden to steal radish?"" Ah Q said and walked away."
24,"""Now ... isn't this?"" Lao Nigu pointed at his pocket."
25,"""Is this yours? Can you call him promise you? You ..."""
26,"Ah Q didn't finish his words, and ran away; he chased a very fat black dog.This was originally in the front door, but somehow came to the back garden.The black dog hummed and chased, and she was already biting A Q's legs. Fortunately, a radish fell from the pocket. The dog was frightened and stopped slightly.Get out of the wall.Only the black dog was still facing the mulberry cricket, and the old nun was thinking about the Buddha."
27,"Ah Q was afraid that Nuni would release the black dog again, picked up the radish and walked away. He picked up a few small stones along the road, but the black dog no longer appeared.Ah Q thus throwing the stone and eating, thinking, and thinking, there is nothing to find here, it is better to go to the city ..."
28,"When the three radish finished eating, he had made up the idea of entering the city."
