"After the Zhao family was robbed, the people of Weizhuang were very fast and panicked, and A Q was quickly and panicked.But four days later, A Q was caught in the county in the middle of the night.At that time, it was the dark night, a team of soldiers, a team of teams, a team of policemen, and five detectives, quietly reached Weizhuang, surrounded the Tulu Temple in a dark, and faced the door of the door. However, A Q did not rush out.Many times did not move, and the total was anxious. After a reward of twenty thousand, only two groups were risky.He was a little sober at the left left."
"When I went to the city, it was noon. When Ah Q saw that he was picked into the door and turned five or six bends, he pushed it into a small house.He just stunned, the fence door made of the whole plant followed his heel, and the remaining three sides were walls. When looking closely, there were two people on the corner of the house."
"Although A Q is a little embarrassed, he is not very distressed, because the bedroom in his Tugu Temple is not clever than the house.The two also seemed to be a rural person, and they gradually got up with him. One said that the master of the grandfather wanted to chase his grandfather, and one did not know what was going on.They asked A Q, A Q Shuangli replied, ""Because I want to rebel."""
"He was caught by the fence gate again in the second half of the day. In the lobby, a old man with a shaved head was sitting on it.He Q is suspicious and he is a monk, but when he saw a row of soldiers standing below, there were more than a dozen gown characters standing on both sides.The fake devils were all shy, looking at him angrily; he knew that this person must have some origin, and the knee joint was naturally loose immediately, and he knelt down."
"""Stand and say! Don't kneel!"" The gown characters said."
"Although Ah Q seemed to understand, he always felt that he couldn't stand, and he couldn't help squatting down, and finally changed his knees."
"""Slave! ..."" The gown characters said despise, but did not call him."
"""You come from the real recruitment, so as not to endure hardships. I have long known. You can let you go."" The old man with the bald head looked at A Q's face and said quietly."
"""Recruit!"" The gown characters also said loudly.""I wanted to ... come to vote ..."" Ah Q Hu Li Hu Tu thought about it, and then said intermittently."
"""So why not come?"" The old man asked with a lot."
"""The fake foreign devils are not allowed to me!"" ""Robber! At this moment, it's too late. Where are your co -party?"""
"""What?......"""
"""That night robbing the Zhao family."""
"""They didn't call me. They moved away by themselves."" Ah Q was angry when he mentioned."
"""Where are you going there? Say it and let you go."" The old man was more peaceful."
"""I don't know, ... they didn't call me ..."""
"However, the old man watched it, and A Q was caught in the fence door again.He grabbed the fence door for the second time, the morning the next day."
The situation in the lobby is always.The old man sitting on the bald head was still kneeling.
"The old man and asked, ""What else do you say?"""
"As soon as A Q thought, there was no words, so he replied, ""No."""
"So a gown character took a piece of paper and sent it to A Q in front of Ah Q, and put the pen in his hands.Ah Q was surprised at this time, almost ""soul and scattered"": because his hands are related to pen, this time is the first time.He didn't know how to get it; the man pointed to a place to teach him to draw flowers."
"""I ... I ... don't recognize the words."" A Q grabbed the pen, and said in panic and ashamed."
"""So, cheap you, draw a circle!"""
"Ah Q is going to draw a circle, but the pen holding the pen is just shaking.So the man paved the paper on the ground for him, and Ah Q went down to paint the circle of his life.He was afraid of being laughing and determined to draw a round, but this abominable pen was not only heavy, but also disobedient. He just shook and almost touched, but he shook out and painted melon seeds."
"A Q was ashamed of his painting, but the man did not care about it. He had already sought the paper and pen, and many people grabbed him for the second time into the fence door.He entered the fence for the second time, and he was not very annoyed.Between the world and earth, he sometimes caught it and sometimes draws a circle on paper.But after a while, it was relieved. He thought: The grandson was very round.So he fell asleep."
"However, this night, the master could not sleep: he and his general vomited.The first master Zhang must pursue the stolen goods, and the first proposition should be the first to show the public.Recently, the master has not taken care of the master, and said, ""punish one hundred! You see, I have not been in the revolutionary party for 20 days, and the case is a dozen.Where is my face? Breaking the case, you are here again.EssenceBut the general said, ""Please, please!"" So the master did not sleep on the night, but fortunately, he did not resign the next day."
"When Ah Q was caught out of the fence door for the third time, it was tomorrow morning that Master could not sleep.When he arrived at the lobby, he was still sitting on the bald old man on it; A Q also kneeling as usual."
"The old man asked kindly, ""Do you have anything else?"""
"As soon as A Q thought, there was no words, so he replied, ""No."""
"Many gowns and short shirts suddenly put on a white vest with a foreign cloth, with some black characters on it.A Q is very angry: Because this is very like filial piety, and filial piety is obscure.However, at the same time, his hands were restrained, and at the same time, he was caught outside the gate."
"A Q was carried on a car without a fluff, and a few short -fitting characters were sitting with him.The car immediately walked around. In front of a group of soldiers and ducts with foreign artillery, there were many guests on both sides. What happened behind, A Q didn't see it.But he suddenly felt: Isn't this going to kill his head? He was anxious, his eyes were dark, and his ears were stunned.However, he didn't get all faint. Although he was anxious, sometimes he was also calm; between his meaning, he seemed that he felt that he was in the world, and sometimes he had to kill."
"He also recognized the way, so he was a little surprised: Why didn't he walk towards the Fa field? He didn't know that it was traveling on the street and showing the public.But even if he knew the same, he just thought that in his life and the earth, sometimes it was time to show the streets to show the public."
"He realized that this was the way around the Fa field, which must be the ""嚓"" killing head.He looked around, and he followed the horse -like person, and inadvertently, he saw a mother Wu in the crowd of the road.For a long time, Yi originally worked in the city.Ah Q was suddenly ashamed of his aspiration: he didn't sing a few plays.His thoughts were like a whirlwind in his head: ""Little Guins on the Grave"" was not so wise, and ""Don the Tiger Fighting"" ""Don’t regret ..."" is too lacking.""Hit you"".He wanted to raise his hands at the same time, so he remembered that the two hands were tied, so the ""holding the steel whip"" did not sing."
"""After twenty years, it's another ..."" Ah Q was busy, saying ""without a teacher"" and never saying."
"""Okay !!!"" From the crowd, the wolf's screaming sound was made."
"The car could not move forward. In the sound of the sound of Ah Q, I turned her eyes to see Wu's mother. It seemed that Yi had never seen him, but just looked at the foreign artillery on the back of the soldiers."
"Ah Q, then look at those who drink."
"At this moment, his thoughts were like a whirlwind in his mind.Four years ago, he met a hungry wolf at the foot of the mountain, and he would never settle him nearly, and he wanted to eat his meat.He was so scared at that time, and fortunately there was a firewood knife in his hand, so he had to fight for this strong and support it; but always remember the wolf's eyes, fierce and timid, shining like two ghost fires, it seemed to seem to be, it seemed to seem to be, it seemed to seem to beFrom a distance, he penetrated his flesh.And this time he saw the more terrible eyes that he had never seen before, and blunt and sharp. Not only did he chew his words, but he also had to chew things other than his flesh. He never followed him."
"These eyes seemed to be in full swing, and they had bit his soul there."
"""Help,......"""
"However, A Q did not say.He had a dark eyes long, and his ears buzzed, feeling that his whole body was scattered with dust."
"As for the influence at the time, the biggest inversed was the master of lingering, because he did not pursue the stolen goods, his family was stunned.Followed by Zhao Mansion, Non -Special Show was reported by a bad revolutionary party because he went to the official to report to the official, and he spent 20,000 rewards, so the whole family also called it.Since this day, they have gradually experienced the smell of old age."
"As for public opinion, there is no objection in Weizhuang, and naturally said that Ah Q is bad. Being shot is his bad evidence: why not be shot dead? But the public opinion in the city is not good. They are mostly not satisfied.I thought that the gunfire was not as good as the killing head; and what kind of ridiculous death row was that, and after so long of the street, they didn't sing a show: they went with him."
December 1921 December.
