"There are, it is said, some victors who delight only in victory against worthy adversaries; to whom the conquest of the weak or stupid is as dust or ashes in their mouths. There are others again who, after overcoming everything and everyone in their path, when the field is strewn with the corpses of the slain, with the obeisances of the surrendered; when there is no enemy left to fight, no friend with which to celebrate - then, and only then, do they feel the desolate solitude of victory. This was not a weakness to which our Ah-Q, in his inexhaustible delight with himself, was susceptible - living proof, perhaps, of the global superiority of Chinese civilization.",0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0

"This latest victory, however, did bring an unusual twist in its tail. Eventually, he floated off to the Temple of Earth and Grain, where, according to well-established custom, he should have immediately lain down and begun snoring. Inexplicably, however, this particular evening he had difficulty keeping his eyes closed. There was something very curious about his thumb and forefinger: both felt softer, silkier than usual.

A woman's what I need.' For in the words of one or other of the ancient sages: There are three ways of betraying your parents, of which dying without descendants is the most serious.' Or then again: 'Those without descendants will become hungry ghosts.'

"The great majority of Chinese men in history would have become saints and sages had they not been ruined by women first. Just look at the Shang dynasty - destroyed by the licentious concubine Da Ji; while Bao Si performed the same service for the Zhou. The Qin dynasty, now... well, the sources aren't entirely unequivocal on this, but were we to surmise there was a woman involved somewhere, we probably wouldn't be wandering too far from the truth.

"Until this point in his career, Ah-Q had been blessed with a character that was rigid in its uprightness. Although we have no way of knowing whether he had ever received personal moral guidance from any celebrated spiritual authority, he had always strictly upheld classically ordained prohibitions concerning the segregation of the sexes, and rejected - with righteous bile - the conduct of heretics such as the young nun or the Fake Foreign Devil. All nuns, as he saw it, were having affairs with monks; any woman walking the streets had designs on strange men; any man or woman in conversation, wherever they were, must be up to no good. He was always disciplining them with his Angry Glare, or with a few sentences of penetrating criticism; if there was nobody else about, he would cast a pebble at them from behind.",0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0
"Yet here he was, at the age of thirty - the year in which Confucius enjoined men to 'stand firm' - losing his head, in a thoroughly un-Confucian way, over a nun. What abominable creatures women truly were; if only that nun's face had not been so bewitchingly smooth, or if it had been modestly veiled, Ah-Q would not, in turn, have submitted to being bewitched. Some five or six years past, wedged within a packed opera audience, he had taken the opportunity to pinch a woman's thigh, but her intervening trousers had protected against this debilitating light-headedness.

When the Zhaos' eldest had been revising for the examinations, he had been allowed a lamp to study in the evening.

The Zhaos didn't burn the candles and incense right away, preferring to keep them for when the mistress of the house next paid her respects to the Buddha.
