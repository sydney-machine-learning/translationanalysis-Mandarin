"After the robbery at the Zhaos’, Weizhuang – Ah-Q included – was abuzz with a kind of pleasurable terror. Four days after the event itself, however, Ah-Q found himself being dragged through the middle of the night into the county town. Under cover of darkness, three squads – of soldiers, of militiamen and of policemen – and five detectives stole into the village and surrounded the Temple of Earth and Grain, propping up machine-guns opposite the main gate. Yet Ah-Q failed to make a dash for it. After a lengthy wait, uninterrupted by any kind of noise or movement, the captain grew anxious enough to offer a reward of twenty thousand coppers, at which two of the militiamen at last bravely volunteered. Once the vanguard had scrambled in over the wall, the forces outside rushed in to capture Ah-Q, who didn’t begin to wake up until he was parked, a prisoner of the law, to the left of the machine-gun outside the temple.

"It was midday by the time they reached the town. Hauled into a dilapidated old yamen, then up and down its corridors and passageways, Ah-Q was at last shoved into a small room. As he stumbled forward, a heavy, barred wooden door slammed behind him. Walls made up the remaining three sides of the room, which turned out to contain – when he made a closer survey of his surroundings – two other people. ",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
"Although a little perturbed by the morning’s events, he wasn’t particularly downcast, because his room in the temple had been no more uplifting to a man’s spirits than the one he currently found himself in. As his new room-mates both looked to be men from the countryside like himself, he gradually fell into conversation with them. Mr Provincial Examination was, he learnt, chasing one of them for rent owed him by his grandfather; the other man didn’t know what he was in for. ‘I wanted to rebel,’ Ah-Q replied frankly, when they asked him what had brought him here.

"Later that afternoon, he was yanked back out through the barred wooden door and into a large hall, at the far end of which sat an old man, his head shaved perfectly smooth. Ah-Q wondered first if he was a monk, until he spotted rows of soldiers, together with some dozen important-looking individuals in long gowns, lined up on either side of the room – their heads either clean-shaven like the old man, or their hair allowed to hang a generous foot down their backs like the Fake Foreign Devil – all glaring savagely at him. At this point, he realized this was an encounter with Authority; his joints automatically weakened and reduced him to his knees. ",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0

"Though Ah-Q felt this melon seed of a circle had covered him in shame, the man seemed unbothered, confiscating both paper and brush. A mass of people now shoved him back, for the second time, behind wooden bars. He did not, in truth, feel too badly about things, this second time. In the rich tapestry that is life, he considered, a man is destined sometimes to be hauled out of places, at others to be shoved in, at others again to draw circles on paper. The only blot on his copybook was his failure to make his circle round. Soon enough, however, his heart was easy once more: only idiots can draw perfect circles, he thought. At which he fell asleep.

"Mr Provincial Examination couldn’t sleep at all that night, brooding over a tiff with his captain of militia. The former had argued that the most urgent task was to go after the booty, while the latter countered that someone needed making a public example of. The captain had of late been showing a distressing want of respect for the esteemed man of letters. ‘Kill a chicken, and you’ll scare the monkeys!’ he declared, thumping the table. ‘It’s less than three weeks since I joined the Revolution, and there have already been a dozen robberies, none of them solved. It’s making me a laughing stock! Here we are, the case solved, and you’re fussing like an old woman. I’ve had it up to here – keep your nose out of this!’ Still the discomforted scholar insisted that he would resign forthwith from the civil administration if they didn’t go after the stolen goods. To which the captain responded: ‘Fine! Resign!’ Mr Provincial Examination failed to sleep that night; but neither, happily, did he resign the following day. ",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0

Crowds of open-mouthed spectators thronged to either side; what lay beyond them, Ah-Q could not see. Was he on his way to an execution? he suddenly wondered.

"In time, it occurred to him that this was the slow road to the execution ground; that his head was definitely going to come off. He looked despondently about him – to one side, then another – at the ant-like audience following his progress. In among the crowds, he happened to spot Mrs Wu. That’s why he hadn’t seen her for ages, he thought; she must have left Weizhuang to work in town. Ah-Q was suddenly ashamed of his absence of spirit: of his failure even to croak out a few lines of opera. His head whirled through the possibilities: The Young Widow lacked grandeur, while the ‘Alas!’ from The Battle of the Dragon and the Tiger was too plaintive. ‘I will thrash you with my mace’ was assuredly his best option.

He had never forgotten the wolf’s eyes, fierce and cowardly, flashing fiendishly, burning into his flesh. But the glazed eyes he was now staring into were more terrifying still: slicing into him, gulping down his words, ravenous for something more than his flesh, following him along at the same distance.

In that whole extended tour around the streets, he hadn’t managed to choke out a single line of opera; they had followed him for nothing. ",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0
