"There are said to be some victors who take no pleasure in a victory unless 
their opponents are as fierce as tigers or eagles: if their adversaries are as 
timid as sheep or chickens they find their triumph empty. There are other 
victors who, having carried all before them, with the enemy slain or 
surrendered, cowering in utter subjection, realize that now no foe, rival, or 
friend is left—they have only themselves, supreme, solitary, desolate, and 
forlorn. Then they find their triumph a tragedy. But our hero was not so 
spineless. He was always exultant. This may be a proof of the moral supremacy of 
China over the rest of the world.",0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0

Devil. His view was, ""All nuns must carry on in secret with monks. If a woman 
walks alone on the street, she must want to seduce bad men. When a man and a 
woman talk together, it must be to arrange to meet."" In order to correct such
