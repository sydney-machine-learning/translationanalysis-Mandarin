"In Ah-Q’s long and illustrious record of victories, it was the slap he had received from Mr Zhao that made his reputation. "
"‘What’s the world coming to?’ he fulminated to himself in bed, after paying off the constable. ‘Sons hitting their fathers...’ Now, if someone as rich and powerful as Mr Zhao was his son... Soon enough, feeling extremely pleased with himself again, he wandered off to the tavern, humming a few lines of opera to himself – The Young Widow at Her Husband’s Grave. Mr Zhao, Ah-Q was prepared to allow, was a cut above the rest of Weizhuang’s scum. "
"The funny thing was that his fellow villagers did begin to treat him with a new respect. Ah-Q may have deluded himself into thinking it was because he actually was Mr Zhao’s father; the real reason was very different. In Weizhuang, public opinion went something like this: no one took any notice if any Li, Wang or Zhang began slapping each other about. It was only when a man of reputation like Mr Zhao got involved that such an imbroglio was singled out for public approbation, with the hittee sharing in the hitter’s glory. Ah-Q, it was of course universally accepted, had been in the wrong, because Mr Zhao was never wrong. How, then, to explain the new awe with which he was regarded? Perhaps – to hazard an unreliable guess at the matter – it all went back to Ah-Q’s claim of blood relation to Mr Zhao. Even though he had been soundly beaten for it, maybe everyone feared there might be some grain of truth to the allegation, and the safest thing would be to mind themselves around him a bit more. Or maybe Ah-Q became as untouchable as the sacrificial beef in Confucius’s ancestral temple – because the sage had once touched it with his sacred chopsticks, it acquired an aura of sanctity for his disciples. "
"For Ah-Q, all this was a source of pride for many years to come. "
"Ambling drunkenly along one spring day, he came upon an individual by the name of Wang sitting in the sunlight at the foot of a wall, stripped to the waist, busily delousing. Ah-Q’s skin suddenly prickled all over. In tribute to his abundance of both facial hair and ringworm, the people of Weizhuang generally acclaimed this Wang as Hairy Ringwormed Wang. Now although – for his own delicate reasons – Ah-Q preferred not to bring up the subject of ringworm, this Wang still enjoyed his utter contempt. Ringworm, for Ah-Q, was nothing to be particularly ashamed of; it was the man’s excessively hairy chops that offered grounds for true scorn. He sat down alongside him. Ah-Q would not have dared sit so carelessly next to any other of Weizhuang’s idlers, but what did he have to fear from this scurvy hair-ball? That he was willing even to sit down next to him was, quite simply, an exalted honour for the wretch.  Ah-Q also took off his tattered jacket, turned it inside out and began checking it over for lice of his own. Perhaps because he had washed it too recently, or because he didn’t look hard enough, after expending much time and effort he succeeded in locating only three or four. He glanced across at Wang, catching one after another and popping them between his teeth. "
"Disappointment quickly gave way to a sense of the tragic injustice of it all. His paltry harvest, next to the bumper crop enjoyed by the vilely hairy Wang: what an extraordinary affront to his dignity it was! He searched desperately, and yet in vain, for a couple of outsized specimens, eventually turning out a middle-sized example of the genre. He stuffed it vengefully into his mouth and bit hard down on it; and yet still the resulting crunch was nothing to the percussive effects that Wang was achieving. "
"‘Hairy slug!’ he spat, his ringworm scars scarlet, throwing his jacket to the ground. "
"‘Talking to me, you scabby dog?’ the hairy one levelled his eyes contemptuously at Ah-Q. "
"Even though Ah-Q had become more imperious of late, thanks to the greater portion of public respect he had grown accustomed to accepting as his due, his courage usually sank to his boots whenever he encountered his regular tormentors among Weizhuang’s idling population. This time, however, he rose heroically to the occasion – was he to stand by and let someone with facial hair like that insult him?  ‘Takes one to know one!’ He stood up, hands on hips. "
"‘Looking for a thrashing, are we?’ Wang now joined him on his feet, pulling his jacket back on. "
"Anticipating Wang’s imminent flight, Ah-Q lunged forward to punch him. But long before the blow had struck home, Wang had grabbed hold of him. Ah-Q now staggered forward, permitting his opponent to drag him by the queue over to the wall, to give his head its customary bashing. "
"‘ “A true gentleman fights with his head, not with his hands!” ’ Ah-Q quoted, his head twisted to one side. "
"Ignoring Ah-Q’s salutary moral injunction in a rather ungentlemanly way, Wang gave Ah-Q’s head five smart cracks against the brickwork, then issued a hefty push that left him sprawled over the ground at six feet’s distance. Satisfied at a job well done, he walked off. "
"This, in Ah-Q’s mental logbook of his life’s achievements, probably counted as his first true humiliation. Because of the man’s appalling whiskers, he had never had anything but pitying contempt for this Wang, who was too contemptible even to despise him back – much less raise a hand against him. But now here he was giving him a thrashing! Ah-Q struggled to make sense of it: perhaps it really was true what he’d heard in the town, maybe the emperor had abolished the civil service examinations5 and the younger Zhao’s success didn’t count for anything any more – had his own reputation also suffered, by association? "
"Ah-Q remained where he was, pondering perplexedly. "
"In the distance, yet another of Ah-Q’s bêtes noires was now approaching, yet another individual for whom Ah-Q felt the greatest disgust: Mr Qian’s eldest son. Some time past, he had gone off to town to enrol in one of the newfangled Academies of Western Learning, then somehow gone off again to Japan. Six months later, he was back, goose-stepping like a foreigner and his queue gone with the fairies. His mother had wept inconsolably, while his wife had tried to commit suicide three times by jumping into the well. Eventually, his mother took to putting it about that ‘wicked people had got him drunk and cut off his queue. Otherwise, he’d have had a top posting by now, but as it is he’ll have to wait till it’s grown back.’ Ah- Q was having none of this, and knew him only as the ‘Fake Foreign Devil’, or ‘Traitor’. Whenever he saw him, his stomach silently churned with invective. "
"It was the false queue he wore that lay behind Ah-Q’s bottomless contempt for him. The wearer of a false queue was sub-human; if his wife didn’t pull off her suicide on the fourth jump, she would never redeem herself in Ah-Q’s eyes. "
And here he was now. 
"‘Bald... ass...’ On previous occasions, Ah-Q had kept his insults safely confined to his own head. This time, however, in his furious desire for revenge against a harsh, cruel world, they crept softly out into the open. "
"The bald villain stormed over, a varnished walking stick in his hand. Realizing, at this instant, that another thrashing was coming his way, Ah-Q braced himself and waited. Predictably enough, a hard object cracked emphatically against his head. "
"‘I meant him!’ Ah-Q pointed to a nearby child.
"
"Whack! Whack, whack!
"
"This, in Ah-Q’s mental logbook of his life’s achievements, probably counted as his second true humiliation. Fortunately, once the rather discordant crack of stick on head had ceased, the whole matter seemed closed and his spirits began to lift. He slowly walked off, setting his great talent for forgetting – the jewel in the crown of his cultural heritage – to work for him again. By the time he reached the entrance to the tavern, he was feeling rather pleased with life. "
"A young nun from the Convent of Quiet Cultivation advanced towards him. She would have got a heckle out of him at the best of times, and now, with the memory of his recent humiliations fresh in his mind, was no time to hold back. Bile rose up at the memory of the day’s debacles. "
"‘Here comes my bad luck!’ he thought, as he strode over and noisily spat at her. "
"Ignoring him, the young nun carried on her way, head bowed. Moving closer still, Ah-Q reached out to rub her shaved scalp. ‘Bald as a coot!’ he laughed moronically. ‘Run back home to your lover-monk!’ "
"‘How dare you...’ the nun protested, her face flushed scarlet, trying to escape. "
"The tavern roared with laughter. ‘Sauce for the goose, sauce for the gander!’ he quipped, now pinching her cheek, delighted his remarkable exploits were getting the recognition they deserved. "
"Another great roar of mirth from the tavern. Unwilling to disappoint his public, a euphoric Ah-Q gave the offending cheek another, harder twist before finally letting go. "
"This great struggle and ultimate victory banished all memory of the hairy Wang, and the Fake Foreign Devil; fitting revenge, it seemed, had been taken on the day’s misfortunes. The curious thing was that he now felt even lighter of heart than he had done after his second beating – so light that he was in danger of floating off into the ether. "
"‘May you die without descendants, Ah-Q!’ the nun could be heard sobbing, as she fled. "
‘Hahaha!’ Ah-Q laughed merrily.s
"‘Hahaha!’ his audience joined in, with only slightly less enthusiasm. "
