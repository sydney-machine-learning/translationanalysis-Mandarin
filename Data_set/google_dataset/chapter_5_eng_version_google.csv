"After Ah Q's Li Li, he still returned to Tugu Temple. The sun went down, and gradually felt a bit monster in the world.He thought about it, and finally realized that the reason was covered with shirtlessness.He remembered that the broken clip was still there, he put it on his body, lay down, and opened his eyes. It turned out that the sun was already on the west wall again.He sat up and said, ""Mom's ..."""
"After he got up, he still strolled on the street. Although it was no more than the pain of shirtlessness, he gradually felt a bit strange in the world.As if from this day, the women in Weizhuang suddenly were afraid of shame. When I saw that Ah Q came, they all hid in the door.Even Zou Qiyi, nearly fifty -year -old, also followed others, and called the eleven daughters in.Ah Q thought it was surprising, and thought: ""Suddenly these things have learned the lady. This daughter -in -law ..."""
"But he felt a little weird in the world, but it was a lot of days.First, the hotel was unwilling to owe it; second, the old man in Guan Tugu Temple said something nonsense, and seemed to call him to leave; Third, although he couldn't remember for many days, there were many days.Short worker.The hotel is not stunned, and it is boiled; the old man urges him to leave, and even Su Yitong is even if no one came to call him a short worker, but he was hungry: This is really a very ""mother"" thing."
"Ah Q couldn't bear it anymore, he had to go to the house of the Paido Gu to ask -but he was not allowed to step into the threshold of Zhao's house -but the situation was also strange: he must go out of a man, and now he is very annoying.Like a response to a beggar, he shakes his hand:"
"""No! You go out!"""
"Ah Q feels more strange.He thought that these people have always been indispensable to help, so that there is no problem now, it should always be a little strange.He kept inquiring and knew that they had to call Xiao Don when they had something.This little D is a poor boy, thin and lacking. In Ah Q's eyes, the position is under Wang Hu. Who expected that the kid actually planned his rice bowl.Therefore, Ah Q's anger is even more different from usual. When I walk angrily, I suddenly raised my hand and sang:"
"""I hold you with a steel whip! ..."""
"A few days later, he met Xiao D in front of Qianfu's picture wall.""The enemies met with each other."" Ah Q welcomed, and Xiao D stood up."
"""Beast!"" Ah Q said angrily, and his mouth was spitting out of his mouth."
"""I'm a worm, okay? ..."" Xiao D said."
"This humility made Ah Q more angry, but he had no steel whip in his hand, so he had to rush up and reached out to pull the braid of Xiao D.Xiao D protects his braid roots with one hand, and he also comes to pull Ah Q's braids in one hand. A Q also protects his braid roots in his empty hand.From the previous perspective of Ah Q, Little D was originally insufficient, but he was hungry recently, thin and lack of Little D, so it became a common phenomenon.They all bent, and a blue rainbow shape was released on the Qianjia Pink Wall, as for a long time."
"""Okay, okay!"" The people who watched said, it was about persuasion."
"""Okay, okay!"" The people said, I don't know if it is persuasion, praise, or incite."
"But they don't listen.Three steps in A Q, Xiao D stepped back three steps, all stood; Xiao D took three steps, Ah Q took three steps, and they all stood.About a little bit, ——Wezhuang rarely has a self -clock, so it is difficult to say, or twenty points -their hair is smoking, and the forehead sweats. Ah Q’s hand was loosened. At the same time,Xiao D's hand was also relaxed, at the same time, straight, retreating, all crowded out."
"""Remember, my mother ..."" Ah Q turned back."
"""Mom, remember ..."" Xiao D also turned around."
"This ""Dragon Tiger Fighting"" does not seem to be victorious, nor does it know that people who watch can be satisfied. None of them are discussing, but no one still calls him to be a short worker."
"One day was very gentle, and the breeze was a little bit summer, but A Q felt cold, but this was still responsible. The first was hungry.Cotton, felt hat, cloth shirt, have long been gone, and then sold cotton jackets; now there are pants, but they are inevitable; there are broken clips, and except for sending people to make a sole, they decided not to sell money.He wanted to pick up a money on the road, but he hasn't seen it yet; he wants to suddenly find a money in his broken house. He panicked, but the house was empty and clear.So he decided to go out for food."
"He walked on the road to ""ask for food"", saw the familiar hotel, and saw the familiar buns, but he had gone through. Not only did he not be suspended, but he didn't want it.What he asked for wasn't such a thing; he asked what he asked, and he didn't know."
"Weizhuang was not in Daicun Town, and after a long time, it went through.Most of the villages are paddy fields, the eyes are full of tender green, and the black spots of a few round activities are sandwiched.A Q didn't appreciate this Tianjiale, but he just left, because he intuitively knew that the way of ""eating"" with him was very long.But he finally walked outside the wall of Jing Xiuyu."
"There is also a paddy field around the ，, and the pink wall protrudes in the new green, and the low earth wall behind is a vegetable garden.Ah Q was suspicious for a while, looking around, and no one.He climbed up the low wall and pulled Ho Shouwu vine, but the soil was still stunned, and A Q's feet also shook; finally climbed mulberry branches and jumped into it.It is really lush inside, but it does not seem to have rice wine buns, as well as other foods.The west wall is a bamboo bush, and many bamboo shoots below are unfortunately not cooked. There are rapeseed early knots. Mustard has flowed, and cabbage is very old."
"Ah Q felt unjustly as if Wen Tongli. He slowly approached the garden door, and suddenly he was very surprised. This was clearly an old radish.He squatted down and pulled it down, and the door suddenly stretched out a very round head, and he shrank back. This was clearly a little nun.The flow of the little nun was that Ah Q was originally like a mustard, but the world had to ""take a step back"", so he quickly pulled up four radishes, twisted the green leaves, and pocked in the big placket.But the old nun has come out."
"""Amitabha, Ah Q, how do you jump into the garden to steal radish! ...... Ah, sin, Ah, Amitabha! ..."""
"""When will I jump into your garden to steal radish?"" Ah Q said and walked away."
"""Now ... this isn't this?"" Lao Nisu pointed at his pocket."
"""This is yours? Can you call him promise you? You ..."""
"Ah Q didn't finish talking, and ran away; he chased a very fat black dog.This was originally in the front door, but somehow came to the back garden.The Black Dog hummed and chased, and she was already biting A Q's legs. Fortunately, a radish fell from the pocket. The dog was frightened and stopped slightly.Get out of the wall.Only the black dog was still facing the mulberry."
"Ah Q was afraid that Nuni would release the black dog again, picked up the radish and walked away. He picked up a few small stones along the road, but the black dog did not reproduce.Ah Q thus throwing a stone, walking on the while, and thinking, there is nothing to find here, it is better to go to the city ..."
"When the three radish finished eating, he had made up the idea of ​​entering the city."
