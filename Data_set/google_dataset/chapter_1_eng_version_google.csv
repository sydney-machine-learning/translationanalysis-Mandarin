"I want to do a right circulation for Ah Q, it has been more than a year or two.But I have to do it, while thinking about it again. This shows that I am not a ""stand -up"" person, because the immortal pen must pass on the immortal person, so people pass on the text, and the text of the text isGradually, it was not even clear, and finally returned to Chuan Ah Q, as if there were ghosts in thought."
"However, it is difficult to make this quick article, and then I feel very difficult.The first is the name of the article.Confucius said, ""If the name is wrong, the words are not smooth.""This should have paid great attention.There are many famous names: biography, autobiography, inside, biography, don't biography, family biography, small passage ... but unfortunately.""Biography"", this article is not ranked in the ""history"" with many wide people; ""autobiography"", I am not Ah Q.What is the ""biography"", where is the ""inner pass""? If ""inner pass"" is used, Ah Q is by no means a god.""Don't biography"", Ah Q has never had a big president to announce the ""Biography"" of the National History Museum -although there is no ""Boxi Biography"" in the British history, Wen Hao Die even has also done the ""Boat Farewell Biography"".Books, but Wenhao is fine, but in my generation, it is not possible.The second is the ""family biography"", but I do n’t know if I have the same ancestors as A Q, nor have it been asked by his descendants; or “small biography”, then Ah Q has no other “big biography”.All in all, this article is also ""this biography"", but from my article, because of the inferiority of the body, it is used by ""the flow of the car to sell the car"", so I dare not say it, and I never enter the novelist of the three religions and nine streams.In the words of ""Gossip and Setting Title"", take the word ""True Story"" as the name, and even the ""True Story"" of ""Calligraphy"" written by the ancients is very mixed, and it is unable to care about it."
"Secondly, the passage of Li Zhuan is probably the first to be ""a certain, the word, and a certain place"", and I don't know what A Q surnames.Once, he seemed to be Zhao, but the next day was blurred.It was when Taiye's son entered the showcase, and the gongs were reported to the village. A Q was drinking two bowls of rice wine and danced. This was also very glorious because he and Taishu Zhao originally had it.In this family, he was still three generations long than Xiu Cai.At that time, a few listening people were a little respected.Knowing that the next day, Di Bao called A Q to go to the house of Zhao Taiye; at first sight, the grandfather was splashed with Zhu, and he drank:"
"""Ah Q, you are a muddy boy! Do you say I am your home?"""
Ah Q doesn't speak.
"Master Zhao looked more and more angry. He grabbed a few steps and said, ""You dare to talk! How can I have a home like you? Are you surnamed Zhao?"" Ah Q did not open and wanted to retreat;Give him a mouth."
"""Why are you surnamed Zhao! -The surname Zhao!"""
"Ah Q did not defend him with his surname Zhao, only touched his left cheek with his hands, and the land insurance retracted out; the outer side was reprimanded by the ground security, thanks to the land insurance for two hundred texts.Everyone who knows said that A Q is too deserted, and he will fight for himself; he may not be surnamed Zhao. Even if the real surname is Zhao, Zhao Taiye is here, and he should not be so nonsense.After that, no one mentioned his clan again, so I finally didn't know what surname A Q was."
"Third, I don't know how A Q's name was written.When he was alive, he called him Ahuei. After he died, no one called Ah Quei again, and there would be ""bamboo"".If it comes to ""Bamboo"", this article should be counted for the first time, so I met this first difficulty first.I thought about it carefully: Agui is Agui or Agui? If his monthly pavilion or do his birthday in August, it must be Agui; and he has neither a nameKnowing him, —— have never tasted posts that have been scattered on birthdays: Writing Agui is arbitrary.And if he has one brother or his brother named Afu, it must be Agui; and he is just one person: writing Agui, and there is no evidence.The remote words of the rest of the sound QUEI are even more unsatisfactory.Earlier, I also asked Mr. Zhao's son, Mr. Maori, who expected that Boya was so public, but according to conclusions, because Chen Duxiu held ""New Youth"" to promote foreign characters, the national essence was reduced, so there was no inspection.It's right.My last means is only to ask a fellow to investigate the case of Ah Q, and eight months later, there was a reply, saying that there was no one who was similar to Ah Quei's voice in the case.Although I don't know if there is no, I still don't check it, but there are no other ways.I'm afraid that the phonetic letter has not yet communicated, I just use the ""foreign characters"", and write him as A Quei according to the British popular spelling.This is nearly blindly obeying ""New Youth"", and I am also sorry, but Mao Cai Gong is still unknown. What else do I have?"
"Fourth, it is Ah Q's home.倘他姓赵，则据现在好称郡望的老例，可以照《郡名百家姓》上的注解，说是“陇西天水人也”，但可惜这姓是不甚可靠的，因此籍贯There is also some uncertainty.Although he lives more, he often stays elsewhere. It cannot be said that it is a fairy. Even if it is ""no -owner"", he still has a good history."
"What I talked about masturbating is that there is a word ""A"" very correct. There is no disadvantage that will be borrowed.As for the rest, they can be worn by the shallow studies. They only hope that Mr. Hu Shizhi, who is ""historical and examined"", may find many new Duanxu in the future, but my ""A Q Together"" is there.When I was afraid of being eliminated early."
The above can be regarded as preface.
