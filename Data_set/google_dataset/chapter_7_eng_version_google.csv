"On September 14, September 14, Xuantong -this day when Ah Q will be sold to Zhao Baiyan -Three more than four o'clock, and a large bundle boat to Hebutou on Zhao House.The ship wandered from the black cricket, and the people in the country were sleeping well, and they didn't know; when they went out, they were almost dawn, but there were a few of them.According to the results of the investigation of the probe, I know that it was actually a ship of the master!"
"The ship was uneasy to Wei Zhuang. Within noon, the people in the village were very shaken.The mission of the ship was very secret, but the Chafang wine restaurant said that the Revolutionary Party wanted to enter the city and lift the master to our countryside to escape.Only Zou Qiyi didn't take it for granted, saying that it was just a few times, and the old man wanted to store it, but he had been replied by Mrs. Zhao.In fact, the master and Zhao Xiucai were not able to have the same friendship. In the reason, there was no friendship of ""common difficulties"". Moreover, Zou Qiyi and the Zhao family were neighbor."
"However, the rumors were very strong. Although the master of the people didn't seem to be kissed, there was a long letter and lined up with the Zhao family.For a round of his belly, he felt that there would be no harm in him, so he left the box, and now he was stuffed under his wife's bed.As for the Revolutionary Party, some said that they entered the city this night, and each of them was a white helmet and white armor: wearing the prime of Emperor Chongzheng."
"In the ears of A Q, I have heard the words of the Revolutionary Party earlier, and this year, I have seen the killing of the Revolutionary Party.But he had an opinion that came from there, thinking that the Revolutionary Party was rebellion, and rebellion was embarrassing with him, so he always was ""deep and disgusted"".Unexpectedly, this made Baili famous for his scare, so he was a bit ""fascinated"". Besides, the panic of a group of birds and women in Weizhuang also made Ah Q more fast.""It's okay to revolution,"" Ah Q thought, ""The life of this group of mothers is too abominable! It's hateful! ...... It is me, and I have to surrender the Revolutionary Party."""
"Ah Q has recently been embarrassed, and it is slightly slightly uneven; I drank two bowls of empty belly wine at noon, getting more and more drunk, and I wanted to walk as one side, and then fluttered again.Somehow, suddenly it seems that the Revolutionary Party is himself, but the Wuzhuang people are all his captives.When he was proud, he couldn't help but yelled loudly:"
"""Rebellion! Rebellion!"""
"The people of the Weizhuang looked at him with a frightened eyes.This pitiful vision was never seen by A Q, and at first sight, he was so comfortable that he drank snow in June.He shouted even more happily:"
"""Okay, ... what I want is what is, who I am happy is."
"Well,!!"
"Regret, drunk, cut off Zheng Xian's brother,"
"I don't regret it, yeah ..."
"Well, ，, so, Qiang Ling!"
"I hold you with a steel whip in my hand ... """
"Two men and two real home on Zhao Mansion are standing at the door and revolution.Ah Q didn't see it, and sang his head straight."
"""Get, ..."""
"""Old Q,"" Grandpa Zhao screamed timidly."
"""Q,"" Ah Q would not expect that his name would be connected to the word ""old"", thinking that it was something else, without doing it with himself, just singing.""Well, Qiang, Qiang Ling Qiang, 锵!"""
"""Old Q."""
"""Regret ..."""
"""Ah!"" Xiucai had to call his name."
"Ah Q then stood up, crooked his head and asked, ""What?"""
"""Old Q, ... now ..."" Grandpa Zhao has nothing to say, ""Now ...?"" Is you getting rich? """
"""Fortune? Naturally. What is it ..."" What is it ... """
"""Ah ... Brother Q, it doesn't matter if you poor friends like us ..."" Zhao Bai said with eyes, it seemed to want to explore the wind of the Revolution."
"""Poor friends? You always have money than me."" A Q said."
"Everyone was indifferent, there was no speech.Grandpa Zhao went home and discussed the lights at night.Zhao Bai returned home, and pulled it off from his waist and gave him a woman hidden in the bottom of the box."
"A Q fluttered and returned to the Tulu Temple, and the wine had been awakened.This night, the old man in Guan Temple was also unexpectedly kind, and asked him to drink tea; A Q asked him two cakes. After eating, he asked for another four or two candles and a tree candlestick.Lying alone in his own house.He couldn't tell fresh and happy, the candlelight jumped like Yuan Ye, and his thoughts also jumped:"
"""Rebellion? Interesting, ... A revolutionary party with a white helmet and white armor came, all holding a knife, steel whip, bomb, foreign cannon, three -pointed and two -edged knife, hooking sickle gun, walking across Takayu TempleCall, ""Ah Q! Go together! 'So go together."
"""At this time, a group of birds and women in Weizhuang were funny, kneeling down,"" Ah Q, Life! 'Who listened to him! The first one damn is Xiao D and Master Zhao, there are Xiucai, and fake foreign devils, ... Is there a few? Wang Hu can still stay, but don't."
"""Things, ... Go straight in and open the box: ingot, foreign money, foreign gauze, ... a Ning -style bed of Xiucai Lady move to Tugu Temple first, in addition to putting the money homeThe table and chair, or with the Zhao family."
"""Zhao Sichen's sister is really ugly. Zou Qiyi's daughter said in a few years. The wife of the fake foreign devil will sleep with a man without a braid, scary, not a good thing! The wife of Xiucai has scars on the eye cells... Wu Ma has been gone for a long time, I don’t know where it is, but unfortunately the feet are too big. """
"A Q didn't want to stop it. He had made a snoring sound. The four or two candles only ordered the small half -inch, and the red flame's light looked at his open mouth."
"""Hehe!"" Ah Q suddenly yelled, raised his head of four cares, and when he saw four or two candles, he fell down again."
"The next day he got up very late, and when he walked out of the street, he was always as usual.He was still hungry, he thought, he couldn't think of anything; but he suddenly seemed to have an idea, slowly crossing the step, and intentionally and unintentionally walked to Jing Xiuyu."
"Lang is as quiet as spring season, white walls and dark doors.He thought for a while, and went to hit the door, and a dog called inside.He hurriedly picked up a few pieces of broken bricks, and then went up to fight more vigorously. When he hit a lot of numbers on the black gate, someone came to open the door."
"A Q quickly pinched the brick, set off the horse step, and was ready to fight with the black dog.However, there was only one seam of the door, and there was no black dog out of it. He looked at only one old nun."
"""What are you doing?"" Yi Da said surprised."
"""Revolution ... you know? ..."" A Q said very much."
"""Revolutionary revolution, revolutionary, ... What are you going to reconcile us?"" The old nun said with red eyes."
"""What? ..."" Ah Q was surprised."
"""You don't know, they have been here!"""
"""Who? ..."" Ah Q was even more surprised."
"""That Xiucai and Western Devil!"""
"Ah Q was surprisingly unexpected, and he couldn't help it; the old nun saw that he lost his anger, and then closed the door quickly. When A Q pushed again, he couldn't open it, and when he hit it again, he didn't answer."
"That's the matter in the morning.The news of Zhao Xiucai, as soon as he knew that the Revolutionary Party had entered the city at night, he put his braids on top, and went to visit the Qian Yang devil who had always been unacceptable in the morning.This is the time of ""salty and the renewal"", so they talked very speculative, and immediately became comrades in love, and also met the revolution.They thought and thought, and then came up with a dragon card in Jingxiu's ""Long live the emperor"", which should be leaned out quickly, so they immediately went to the revolution in the same way.Because the old nun came to stop, they said three words, and they regarded Yi as a full government, and gave a lot of sticks and chestnuts on their heads.After the aunts treated them, they set up God to check. Although the dragon card was broken to the ground, and she disappeared a Xuande furnace in front of Guanyin Niangniang.This incident was later learned.He regretted falling asleep himself, but also surprised that they did not come to greet him.He took a step back and thought:"
"""Didn't they know that I have surrendered the Revolutionary Party?"""
