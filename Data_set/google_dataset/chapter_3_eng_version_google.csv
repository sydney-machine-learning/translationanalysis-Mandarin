"It is strange to say, since then, everyone has also respected him.This is in Ah Q, or he thinks that because he is the father of Taiyong Zhao, it is not actually.For example, if Ah Qi beats A Ba, or Li Si fights Zhang San, it has always been a monument.As soon as you go on the monument, the name is well -known, and he is named as an obedient.As for the mistake in Ah Q, it is not necessary to say.So what is it? Because Master Zhao is not wrong.But since he is wrong, why do you seem to respect him in particular? This is difficult to solve, or because A Q said that he is the family’s family, although he was beaten, everyone is still afraid of some truth.secure.Otherwise, it is also like a jail in the Confucian Temple. Although the same as pigs and sheep, the same is the same as the saints, but the Confucianists dare not act."
A Q has been proud of many years since then.

In the sunlight of the wall, he saw Wang Hu's naked lice and catching lice, and he suddenly felt itchy.This king Hu and Hu and Hu, others called him Wang Huhu, but A Q deleted a word, but he looked at him very well.The meaning of Ah Q is not surprising that it is not surprising.

Honestly: He is willing to sit down, and he still raises him.A Q also took off the broken clip and checked it for a while.

His mother cried more than a dozen games.His wife jumped three times.Later, his mother said everywhere, ""This braid was drunk by the bad guys. It was possible to be a big official, and now he had to wait for the long -term long.""""It is also called"" Litong Foreign "". When he saw him, he must be secretly cursing in his stomach."
"A Q, especially ""deeply evil and annoyed"", is his fake braid.As of the fake braid, there is no qualification for being a man; his wife does not jump back for the fourth well, nor is it a good woman."
"This ""false ghost"" has been recently."
