      "Weizhuang did not catch another glimpse of Ah-Q until just past the Mid-Autumn Festival. Remarking in surprise upon his sudden return, the villagers suddenly wondered where he had been all this time. Whenever he had taken himself off to town before, Ah-Q had been quick to mouth off about it. This time, however, he had kept curiously quiet, so no one had paid any attention. Maybe he had told the old caretaker in the temple. In any case, only trips to town undertaken by people of consequence - by Messrs Zhao or Qian, or the local genius - were public events in Weizhuang. If even the exploits of the Fake Foreign Devil failed to count as newsworthy, then what claim did Ah-Q have on the village's notice? Maybe that was why the old man had not broadcast the news, leaving the rest of Weizhuang society in the dark. @  Yet Ah-Q seemed changed - even remarkably so - on his return from this particular trip. One evening, near nightfall, he suddenly appeared, sleepy-eyed, in the doorway to the tavern. Walking up to the bar, he pulled from his belt a fistful of silver and copper coins. 'Wine!' he barked, throwing them down. 'I'm paying cash!' He had on a new cotton jacket, his belt drooping visibly from the weight of the purse at his waist. Weizhuang lore held that cautious deference - rather than outright rudeness - was the best policy around those who acted in any way unusually. Even though everyone recognized him as Ah-Q, his possession of a new jacket meant that a reassessment was perhaps in order. Waiter, manager, drinkers and other random passers-by arranged their faces into expressions of tentative respect. @  'Well, Ah-Q,' the manager began, nodding at him. 'Long time no see!' @  'Reckon so.' @  'Made a pile, I see... in...?' @  'In town!' @  By the following day, the news had spread through Weizhuang like wildfire. Everyone wanted to hear about the rise of the new Ah-Q, with his new jacket and ready cash - a story that gradually leaked out in the tavern, in the teahouse and under the temple eaves, to universal gasps of admiration and respect. @  As Ah-Q told it, he had started out helping in the household of a local bigwig who had passed the provincial-level civil service examination. (An awed hush fell over his audience as this detail was revealed.) The scholar in question went by the name of Bai, but because he was the only provincial examination laureate in the entire town, no one ever needed to refer to him by his real name. For thirty miles around and about, everyone - and not just Weizhuang - thought his full name was Mr Provincial Examination. To work in the house of such a grandee was, of course, a mighty achievement in itself. But, Ah-Q told his listeners, he got fed up with being a servant, because the revered gentleman was, to state the facts simply, a pain in the damn neck. A delicious sigh of happy regret now rippled through his audience: no one had imagined for a moment that Ah-Q was worthy of working in the household of Mr Provincial Examination; and yet to throw in such a position was still a shame. @ As Ah-Q told it, he had come back because the people in town got on his nerves: with their 'narrow benches', and their shredded onions, and - a new failing Ah-Q had had opportunity to observe - the women's failure to wiggle their hips properly when they walked. But the town had its points, too. The peasants of Weizhuang, for example, gambled with bits of bamboo - only the Fake Foreign Devil knew anything about 'moh-jang' [sic]. In town, though, even the lowest lowlife were experts at the game. Pit the Fake Foreign Devil against a ten-year-old beggar from town, and he'd be mincemeat. (At which disrespect, every listener blushed.) @  'Ever seen an execution?' asked Ah-Q. 'Now, that's a sight. They're always executing revolutionaries. Oh, it's a sight, a sight...' He shook his head excitably about, stars of spittle moistening the face of Zhao Sichen opposite. His listeners' wonder was now edged with dread. Looking about him, Ah-Q suddenly raised his right hand then sliced it down on to the outstretched nape of a rapt hairy Wang. @  'Hwah!' @  The terrified Wang pulled in his neck as quick as he could, while everyone else enjoyed a pleasurable frisson of horror. For days afterwards, Wang was far from his usual self. Neither he - nor anyone else for that matter - dared go anywhere near Ah-Q. @  Although to claim that Ah-Q's status, in the eyes of Weizhuang at large, had now risen higher than that of Mr Zhao would have been an exaggeration, we would not be overstating the case to say that the two men were now, more or less, on a level. @  Soon after, Ah-Q's new celebrity spread to the ladies' chambers of Weizhuang. To put this in a little perspective, there were only two serious establishments in Weizhuang - the Qians' and the Zhaos' - and so the great majority of the village's boudoirs were pretty poor sorts of places. All the same, given Ah-Q's record with women, this latest development was not far off miraculous. Whenever the local women met, they would be sure to mention that Mrs Zou had bought a blue silk skirt from Ah-Q; true, it was second-hand, but it only cost her ninety coppers. Then there was Zhao Baiyan's mother - though some said it was Zhao Sichen's mother; further verification required - who bought a child's shirt of dark red muslin, barely worn, for only two hundred and seventy-six coppers. Suddenly, Ah-Q was the man of the moment: those deficient in silk skirts wanted silk skirts; those deprived of muslin shirts wanted muslin shirts. Now, not only did Weizhuang's women stand their ground when they caught sight of him, they sometimes even called him back after he had walked off. @  'Any more silk skirts, Ah-Q? No? Or muslin shirts, got any of them?' @  Eventually, the news seeped into even the great boudoirs of the village. Excessively pleased with her purchase, Mrs Zou invited Mrs Zhao to admire her silk skirt, of which the latter spoke - in the most elevated terms - to Mr Zhao. On discussing the question at the dinner table with his learned son, Mr Zhao concluded that while the exercise of caution about the house would be advisable as there was doubtless something fishy about this business with Ah-Q) he might have one or two decent things. It just so happened that their esteemed wife and mother was currently after a good fur waistcoat at a reasonable price. And so a clan resolution was passed, to the effect that Mrs Zou would be deputed at once to seek out Ah-Q, and a third exception made to the no-lamps-after-dinner rule. @  The lamps burned, and burned; still Ah-Q did not appear. Anxiety, fatigue, resentment rippled through the assembled Zhao clan: indignation at the skittishness of Ah-Q, impatience at the slowness of Mrs Zou. Mrs Zhao expressed concern that Ah-Q was too frightened to come, because of the events of last spring. Mr Zhao batted her worries away: this time, he had personally commanded Ah-Q's presence. At last, fully proving that Mr Zhao could never be wrong, in came Ah-Q, behind Mrs Zou. @  'He keeps on saying he hasn't anything left,' Mrs Zou reported, rather out of breath. 'I said he should tell you in person, but he still kept on, so I said...' @  'So - Mr Zhao!' Ah-Q took up position beneath the eaves, the corners of his mouth flirting with the ghost of a smile. @  'We hear that life outside Weizhuang has treated you well,' Mr Zhao walked over, sizing this new Ah-Q up. \"That's excellent - excellent. We've... also heard that you've picked up some second-hand things along the way... Bring them over to show us, will you... just in case...' @  'I already told Mrs Zou. I've nothing left.' @  \"Nothing?' Mr Zhao faltered. @  \"It all belonged to a friend of mine, and there wasn't much to begin with. they've all been sold to other people?' @  \"There must be something left.' @  'Only a door curtain.' @  \"Bring it over,' Mrs Zhao quickly commanded. @  \"Tomorrow will be fine,' Mr Zhao did not sound particularly enthusiastic. 'But next time you have anything, show us first.' @  \"We'll pay better than anyone else!' said the village genius. His wife glanced across at Ah-Q, to see if this had any impact on him. @  'I want a fur waistcoat,' Mrs Zhao said. @  After signalling his assent, Ah-Q slouched out so indifferently that no one could tell whether he really meant it. The whole disappointing encounter vexed Mr Zhao so much that he quite stopped yawning. His son was equally agitated by Ah-Q's attitude: We should watch ourselves around this bastard, he warned. Maybe we should tell the constable to throw him out of Weizhuang. Mr Zhao resisted the idea, wary of making an enemy of Ah-Q. As likely as not, someone in his line of business wouldn't shit on his own doorstep. The villagers had nothing to worry about; they just needed to take a bit more care at night. The learned son immediately submitted to the wisdom of the father, retracted his previous advocacy and exhorted Mrs Zou to say nothing, under any circumstances, of it to anyone else. @  But when she took her skirt to be dyed black the following day, Mrs Zou spread the word concerning the suspicions about Ah-Q's character. Even though she made no direct mention of the village genius's idea, the damage to Ah-Q's reputation was done. First of all, the constable called on him to confiscate his door curtain, refusing to return it even when Ah-Q told him Mrs. Zhao wanted to look at it, then demanding a monthly offering from him to demonstrate his respect for the agent of the law. Second, the villagers' attitude towards him underwent an abrupt change: although they still did not dare provoke him as they once had, although the dread generated by his execution monologue had faded, they gave him a wide berth - kept a respectful distance, you might say. @  All except a handful of Weizhuang's wastrels, that is, who were determined to get to the bottom of the business with Ah-Q. Delighted to crow about his exploits, Ah-Q proudly spilled the whole thing out. He'd been, they learnt, the pettiest of petty thieves: incapable not only of clambering over walls, but also of wriggling through holes. His sole talent was to stand outside the entry point to a house and take the goods as they were passed to him. One particular night, after only one bundle had emerged, a volley of shouts broke out when their ringleader returned inside, at which point he ran through the night, out of the town and all the way back to Weizhuang, his stomach for this line of work quite gone. This story did further damage to Ah-Q's already fragile reputation. Those who up until then had kept a respectful distance for fear of making an enemy of him now discovered that he didn't even deserve their fear - that he was a thief too spineless to steal. @  \n"
