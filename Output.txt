There are, it is said, some victors who delight only in victory  against worthy
adversaries; to whom the conquest of the weak or stupid is as dus t or ashes in their
mouths. There are others again who, after overcoming everything  and everyone in
their path, when the field is strewn with the corpses of the sla in, with the obeisances
of the surrendered; when there is no enemy left to fight, no frie nd with which to
celebrate – then, and only then, do they feel the desolate solitude of  victory. This
was not a weakness to which our Ah-Q, in his inexhaustible delight w ith himself,
was  susceptible  –  living  proof,  perhaps,  of  the  global  superiority  o f  Chinese
civilization.
See him now: walking on air after a busy day of moral victory!
This latest victory, however, did bring an unusual twist in its tai l. Eventually, he
floated off to the Temple of Earth and Grain, where, according  to well-established
custom, he should have immediately lain down and begun snoring. Inexplicabl y,
however, this particular evening he had difficulty keeping his eyes clo sed. There
was something very curious about his thumb and forefinger: both fel t softer, silkier
than usual. Had something on the nun’s face attached itself to his  fingers, or had her
face rubbed them smooth?
‘May you die without descendants!’ echoed in the cathedral of Ah-Q’s  mind.
‘She’s quite right,’ he thought to himself. ‘I ought to have a wo man. If I die without
descendants, I’ll have no one to offer a bowl of rice at my gr ave… A woman’s what
I need.’ For in the words of one or other of the ancient sage s: ‘There are three ways
of betraying your parents, of which dying without descendants is the mo st serious.’
Or then again: ‘Those without descendants will become hungry ghosts.’ His thinking
on this point was, therefore, fully in line with scripture; a pity , then, that his
approach to resolving the difficulty erred on the unorthodox side.
‘Woman…’ he thought. ‘Must… find… woman…
‘Sauce for the goose…’ he thought some more, ‘… must… find… woman!’
As to when, exactly, Ah-Q began snoring that evening, we have no reli able
information. The only point on which we can be certain is that he  fell asleep with
that light-headed feeling of satiny smoothness still on his fingertips. ‘Wo man…’
Irrefutable proof that women are at the root of all evil.
The great majority of Chinese men in history would have become saints and sages
had they not been ruined by women first. Just look at the Shang dynasty –  destroyed
by the licentious concubine Da Ji; while Bao Si performed the sa me service for the
Zhou. The Qin dynasty, now… well, the sources aren’t entirely unequivoc al on this,
but were we to surmise there was a woman involved somewhere, w e probablywouldn’t be wandering too far from the truth. Moving swiftly on t o attested fact and
the Later Han,6 it was of course yet another concubine, Diao Chan, who led Dong
Zhuo to his death.
Until this point in his career, Ah-Q had been blessed with a charac ter that was
rigid in its uprightness. Although we have no way of knowing whether  he had ever
received personal moral guidance from any celebrated spiritual a uthority, he had
always strictly upheld classically ordained prohibitions concerning  the segregation
of the sexes, and rejected – with righteous bile – the conduct of he retics such as the
young nun or the Fake Foreign Devil. All nuns, as he saw it, were ha ving affairs
with monks; any woman walking the streets had designs on strange m en; any man
or woman in conversation, wherever they were, must be up to no good.  He was
always  disciplining  them  with  his  Angry  Glare,  or  with  a  few  se ntences  of
penetrating criticism; if there was nobody else about, he would c ast a pebble at them
from behind.
Yet here he was, at the age of thirty – the year in which Confuci us enjoined men to
‘stand firm’ – losing his head, in a thoroughly un-Confucian way, over  a nun. What
abominable creatures women truly were; if only that nun’s face ha d not been so
bewitchingly smooth, or if it had been modestly veiled, Ah-Q would not , in turn,
have submitted to being bewitched. Some five or six years past, we dged within a
packed opera audience, he had taken the opportunity to pinch a woman’s thig h, but
her intervening trousers had protected against this debilitating l ight-headedness.
That heretic vixen of a nun, with her shameless naked face.
‘Woman…’ Ah-Q went on thinking.
Ah-Q often kept women he suspected of having designs on strange men  under
close surveillance, but they never smiled at him. He also liste ned carefully to
women who spoke to him; but they never tried to seduce him either.  Further proof
of female perfidy: they were all of them hypocrites, pretending t hey were pure as
the driven snow.
One evening, after a day spent husking rice at Mr Zhao’s, Ah-Q sat  in the kitchen
smoking a postprandial pipe of tobacco. In other households, casual  labour went
back home after dinner, but at the Zhaos’, dinner was served early and  exceptions
occasionally made to the rule against keeping the lamps on afte r dinner. When the
Zhaos’ eldest had been revising for the examinations, he had been all owed a lamp to
study in the evening. And when they hired Ah-Q for odd jobs, he was permit ted a
lamp to get on with his rice-husking after it got dark. And so  it was that Ah-Q came
to be sitting in the kitchen, taking his time over his pipe before  he went back to his
work.
Once the dishes were done, Mrs Wu, the Zhaos’ only maid, sat down on  the bench
to chat to Ah-Q.‘The mistress hasn’t eaten for two days, because the master i s going to buy a
concubine…’
‘Woman… Mrs Wu…’ Ah-Q thought. ‘She’s still young… a widow…’
‘The young mistress is having a baby in the eighth month…’
‘Woman…’
Ah-Q put down his pipe and stood up.
‘She’s – ’ Wu chattered on.
‘Sleep with me!’ Ah-Q suddenly rushed forward, dropping to his knees bef ore
her.
There was a moment of stunned silence before she fled the room , shuddering, her
screams rippled with sobs.
After staring perplexedly at the wall a while, still on his knee s, Ah-Q placed both
hands down on the empty bench and propelled himself slowly back to his fe et,
assailed by a sense that he could have somehow handled things better.  Having
distractedly tucked his pipe into his belt, he decided to return to his  rice-husking. At
which moment a heavy object landed, with a thump, on his head. Spinning round,  he
discovered the village genius – the Zhaos’ eldest – standing in fro nt of him holding
a large bamboo pole.
‘You filthy little…’
Down came the bamboo again. Covering his head with both hands, Ah-Q t ook the
weight of the blows directly on the joints of his fingers, whic h caused him no little
pain. He rushed out of the kitchen, taking a valedictory strike to the back as he went.
‘Bastard!’ The man of letters honoured him with a touch of scholarly invective.
His fingers still stinging, Ah-Q took solitary refuge in the  rice-husking room,
feeling deeply unsettled by this ‘bastard’. No common-or-garden te rm of abuse
around Weizhuang, it was a usage favoured by the well-to-do, by those  with official
connections. He was no longer in any mood for romance. But sinc e the bamboo and
the expletive seemed to have brought the whole matter to a clos e, Ah-Q set to his
husking again, as if a heavy weight had been lifted from his mind. So on, beginning
to overheat from the exertion of the work, he paused to remove s ome layers of
clothing.
As he did so, he heard a great commotion outside. Now Ah-Q loved nothing better
than a spectacle and so out he went in search of it. The noise  drew him inexorably to
the inner courtyard around which Mr Zhao’s apartments were arrange d. Although
dusk had fallen, he could still make out many of the assembled company  – all the
resident members of the Zhao clan, including the hunger-striking lady  of the house,
Mrs Zou from next door, and a couple of slightly more distant re latives, Zhao
Baiyan and Zhao Sichen.
‘Come on out.’ Mr Zhao’s daughter-in-law was trying to coax M rs Wu out of theservants’ quarters. ‘Don’t let it upset you.’
‘No one thinks the worse of you,’ Mrs Zou interpolated, ‘you mustn’t  think of
killing yourself.’
Mrs Wu’s response was incoherent with sobs.
‘Rum,’ Ah-Q thought to himself. ‘What’s up with her?’ As he sidle d over to Zhao
Sichen, in the hope of learning more, he became swiftly aware of  a rapid approach
from Mr Zhao, who was holding a thick bamboo stick of his own. R eminded of the
thrashing he had not long ago received from Zhao junior, he deduced tha t the
present lively situation might have something to do with him. Turni ng to exit back
to the husking floor, he found his path blocked by this new stick. Logic ally enough,
he decided to leave by the back door, and soon found himself back inside t he
Temple of Earth and Grain.
After sitting there a while, Ah-Q began to feel goose bumps pr ickling his skin.
The spring nights were still not warm enough to go comfortabl y bare-chested. He
had, he now remembered, left his shirt at the Zhaos’; memory of  the bamboo
discouraged him from trying to retrieve it. At which point the  village constable
entered.
‘Damn you, Ah-Q! Can’t you even keep your hands off the Zhaos’ servants?  I
haven’t slept a wink tonight thanks to this mess. Damn you!’
On he went for a while, lecturing Ah-Q on his various misdeeds, to  which the
latter very naturally had nothing to say. As their meeting drew  to its conclusion, Ah-
Q had to tip the constable four hundred coppers – double the usual rate  – because
he’d been called out at night. Since Ah-Q had no cash on him, he mort gaged his felt
hat, then was obliged to sign up to the following five conditions.
 
1.  To take a pair of red candles – a pound each – and a packet of inc ense to the
Zhaos’ tomorrow, as an apology.
2.  To cover the costs of the Daoist priest that the Zhaos ha d hired to exorcize
evil spirits.
3.  Never to set foot, ever again, over the Zhaos’ threshold.
4.  If any accident, of any unforeseen kind, were subsequently to befall M rs
Wu, Ah-Q, and Ah-Q alone, would be held responsible.
5.  To abandon all hope of recovering his wages or shirt.
 
Regrettably, Ah-Q lacked the funds to make good his indemnity. But  as, by happy
coincidence, it was spring, he was able to do without his cotton  quilt, which he
pawned for two thousand coppers, enabling him to fulfil the demands of  the peace
treaty. After kowtowing, bare-chested, he found himself with a f ew coppers leftover, which he chose to blow on wine rather than redeem his felt  hat. The Zhaos
didn’t burn the candles and incense right away, preferring to keep them  for when the
mistress of the house next paid her respects to the Buddha. Most  of his tattered old
shirt was recycled into nappies for the baby that was born to the  younger mistress in
the eighth month; any off-cuts were used by Mrs Wu for the soles of her shoes.
